Otter is a pure, source-level symbolic executor for C that can be used
to test programs. Using Otter, a program may be given symbolic inputs,
and Otter will explore all possible executions of the program for any
value of those inputs to find bugs such as invalid pointer
dereferences, buffer overflows, and other run time errors as well as
verify assertions in the source code.
